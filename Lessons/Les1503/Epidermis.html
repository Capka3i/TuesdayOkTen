            <p>
                The epidermis is the outermost of the three layers that make up the skin, the inner layers being the
                dermis and
                hypodermis. The epidermis layer provides a barrier to infection from environmental pathogens and
                regulates
                the amount of water released from the body into the atmosphere through transepidermal water loss. The
                epidermis is composed of multiple layers of flattened cells that overlie a base layer (stratum basale)
                composed of columnar cells arranged perpendicularly.
            </p>
            <p>
                The rows of cells develop from stem cells in the basal layer. Cellular mechanisms for regulating water
                and
                sodium levels (ENaCs) are found in all layers of the epidermis.
            </p>
            <p>
                The word epidermis is derived through Latin from Ancient Greek epidermis, itself from Ancient Greek epi
                'over,
                upon' and from Ancient Greek derma 'skin'. Something related to or part of the epidermis is termed
                epidermal.
            </p>
            <p>
                The human epidermis is a familiar example of epithelium, particularly a stratified squamous epithelium.

            <h3 id = "#Cellular_components">Cellular components</h3>
            <p>The epidermis primarily consists of keratinocytes (proliferating basal and differentiated suprabasal),
                which
                comprise
                90% of its cells, but also contains melanocytes, Langerhans cells, Merkel cells,:2–3 and inflammatory
                cells.
                Epidermal thickenings called Rete ridges (or rete pegs) extend downward between dermal papillae. Blood
                capillaries
                are found beneath the epidermis, and are linked to an arteriole and a venule. The epidermis itself has
                no
                blood
                supply
                and is nourished almost exclusively by diffused oxygen from the surrounding air.</p>
            <h3 class = "sh1" id = "Cell_junctions">Cell junctions</h3>
            <p>Epidermal cells are tightly interconnected to serve as a tight barrier against the exterior environment.
                The
                junctions
                between the epidermal cells are of the adherens junction type, formed by transmembrane proteins called
                cadherins.
                Inside
                the cell, the cadherins are linked to actin filaments. In immunofluorescence microscopy, the actin
                filament
                network
                appears as a thick border surrounding the cells,[5] although the actin filaments are actually located
                inside
                the
                cell
                and run parallel to the cell membrane. Because of the proximity of the neighboring cells and tightness
                of
                the
                junctions,
                the actin immunofluorescence appears as a border between cells.</p>
            <h3 class = "sh1" id = "Layers">Layers</h3>
            <p>The epidermis is composed of 4 or 5 layers, depending on the region of skin being considered. Those
                layers in
                descending order are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>cornified layer (stratum corneum)</li>
                <p class = "zerotop">Composed of 10 to 30 layers of polyhedral, anucleated corneocytes (final step of
                    keratinocyte
                    differentiation),
                    with the palms and soles having the most layers. Corneocytes contain a protein envelope (cornified
                    envelope
                    proteins) underneath the plasma membrane, are filled with water-retaining keratin proteins, attached
                    together
                    through corneodesmosomes and surrounded in the extracellular space by stacked layers of lipids. Most
                    of
                    the
                    barrier functions of the epidermis localize to this layer.</p>
                <li>clear/translucent layer (stratum lucidum, only in palms and soles)</li>
                <p class = "zerotop">This narrow layer is found only on the palms and soles. The epidermis of these two
                    areas
                    is known
                    as "thick skin"
                    because with this extra layer, the skin has 5 epidermal layers instead of 4.</p>
                <li>granular layer (stratum granulosum)</li>
                <p class = "zerotop">Keratinocytes lose their nuclei and their cytoplasm appears granular. Lipids,
                    contained

                    those keratinocytes
                    within lamellar bodies, are released into the extracellular space through exocytosis to form a lipid
                    barrier.
                    Those polar lipids are then converted into non-polar lipids and arranged parallel to the cell
                    surface.
                    For
                    example glycosphingolipids become ceramides and phospholipids become free fatty acids.</p>

                    polar lipids, glycosphingolipids, free sterols, phospholipids and catabolic enzymes. Langerhans
                    cells,
                    immunologically active cells, are located in the middle of this layer.</p>
                <li>basal/germinal layer (stratum basale/germinativum).</li>
                <p class = "zerotop">Composed mainly of proliferating and non-proliferating keratinocytes, attached to the

                    hemidesmosomes. Melanocytes are present, connected to numerous keratinocytes in this and other

                    through
                    dendrites. Merkel cells are also found in the stratum basale with large numbers in touch-sensitive
                    sites
                    such as
                    the fingertips and lips. They are closely associated with cutaneous nerves and seem to be involved
                    in

            </ul>
            <p>The Malpighian layer (stratum malpighi) is both the stratum basale and stratum spinosum.[4] </p>

            <p>The epidermis is separated from the dermis, its underlying tissue, by a basement membrane.</p>

            <h3 id = "Cellular_kinetics">Cellular kinetics</h3>
            <h4 class = "sh1" id = "Cell_division">Cell division</h4>
            <p> As a stratified squamous epithelium, the epidermis is maintained by cell division within the stratum
                basale.
                Differentiating cells delaminate from the basement membrane and are displaced outward through the
                epidermal
                layers,
                undergoing multiple stages of differentiation until, in the stratum corneum, losing their nucleus and
                fusing
                to
                squamous sheets, which are eventually shed from the surface (desquamation). Differentiated keratinocytes
                secrete
                keratin proteins, which contribute to the formation of an extracellular matrix that is an integral part
                of
                the skin
                barrier function. In normal skin, the rate of keratinocyte production equals the rate of loss, taking
                about
                two
                weeks for a cell to journey from the stratum basale to the top of the stratum granulosum, and an
                additional
                four
                weeks to cross the stratum corneum. The entire epidermis is replaced by new cell growth over a period of
                about 48
                days.</p>
            <h4 id = "Calcium_concentration">Calcium concentration</h4>
            <p>Keratinocyte differentiation throughout the epidermis is in part mediated by a calcium gradient,
                increasing
                from the
                stratum basale until the outer stratum granulosum, where it reaches its maximum, and decreasing in the
                stratum
                corneum. Calcium concentration in the stratum corneum is very low in part because those relatively dry
                cells
                are not
                able to dissolve the ions. This calcium gradient parallels keratinocyte differentiation and as such is
                considered a
                key regulator in the formation of the epidermal layers.</p>
            <p>Elevation of extracellular calcium concentrations induces an increase in intracellular free calcium
                concentrations. Part of that intracellular increase comes from calcium released from intracellular
                stores
                and another part comes from transmembrane calcium influx, through both calcium-sensitive chloride
                channels
                and voltage-independent cation channels permeable to calcium. Moreover, it has been suggested that an
                extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) also contributes to the rise in intracellular calcium
                concentration.</p>
            <h3 id = "Development">Development</h3>
            <p>Epidermal organogenesis, the formation of the epidermis, begins in the cells covering the embryo after
                neurulation,
                the formation of the central nervous system. In most vertebrates, this original one-layered structure
                quickly
                transforms into a two-layered tissue; a temporary outer layer, the periderm, which is disposed once the
                inner basal
                layer or stratum germinativum has formed.</p>
            <p>This inner layer is a germinal epithelium that gives rise to all epidermal cells. It divides to form the
                outer
                spinous layer (stratum spinosum). The cells of these two layers, together called the Malpighian layer(s)
                after
                Marcello Malpighi, divide to form the superficial granular layer (Stratum granulosum) of the
                epidermis.</p>
            <p>The cells in the stratum granulosum do not divide, but instead form skin cells called keratinocytes from
                the
                granules
                of keratin. These skin cells finally become the cornified layer (stratum corneum), the outermost
                epidermal
                layer,
                where the cells become flattened sacks with their nuclei located at one end of the cell. After birth
                these
                outermost
                cells are replaced by new cells from the stratum granulosum and throughout life they are shed at a rate
                of
                0.001 -
                0.003 ounces of skin flakes every hour, or 0.024-0.072 ounces per day.</p>
            <p>Epidermal development is a product of several growth factors, two of which are:</p>

            <h3 id = "Barrier">Barrier</h3>
            <p>The epidermis serves as a barrier to protect the body against microbial pathogens, oxidant stress (UV
                light), and chemical compounds, and provides mechanical resistance to minor injury. Most of this barrier
                role is played by the stratum corneum.</p>
            <h4>Characteristics</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Physical barrier: Epidermal keratinocytes are tightly linked by cell–cell junctions associated to
                    cytoskeletal proteins, giving the epidermis its mechanical strength.
                </li>
                <li>Chemical barrier: Highly organized lipids, acids, hydrolytic enzymes, and antimicrobial peptides
                    inhibit passage of external chemicals and pathogens into the body.
                </li>
                <li>Immunologically active barrier: The humoral and cellular constituents of the immune system found
                    in the epidermis actively combat infection.
                </li>
                <li>Water content of the stratum corneum drops towards the surface, creating hostile conditions for
                    pathogenic microorganism growth.
                </li>
                <li>An acidic pH (around 5.0) and low amounts of water make the epidermis hostile to many microorganic
                    pathogens.
                </li>
                <li>Non-pathogenic microorganisms on the surface of the epidermis help defend against pathogens by
                    competing for food, limiting its availability, and producing chemical secretions that inhibit the
                    growth of pathogenic microbiota.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Permeability</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Psychological stress, through an increase in glucocorticoids, compromises the stratum corneum and
                    thus the barrier function.
                </li>
                <li>Sudden and large shifts in humidity alter stratum corneum hydration in a way that could allow entry
                    of pathogenic microorganisms.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id = "Skin_hydration">Skin hydration</h3>
            <p>The ability of the skin to hold water is primarily due to the stratum corneum and is critical for
                maintaining healthy skin. Skin hydration is quantified using corneometry. Lipids arranged
                through a gradient and in an organized manner between the cells of the stratum corneum form a barrier to
                transepidermal water loss.</p>
            <h3 id = "Skin_color">Skin color</h3>
            <p>
                The amount and distribution of melanin pigment in the epidermis is the main reason for variation in skin
                color in Homo sapiens. Melanin is found in the small melanosomes, particles formed in melanocytes from
                where they are transferred to the surrounding keratinocytes. The size, number, and arrangement of the
                melanosomes vary between racial groups, but while the number of melanocytes can vary between different
                body regions, their numbers remain the same in individual body regions in all human beings. In white and
                Asian skin the melanosomes are packed in "aggregates", but in black skin they are larger and distributed
                more evenly. The number of melanosomes in the keratinocytes increases with UV radiation exposure, while
                their distribution remain largely unaffected.

            <p>Laboratory culture of keratinocytes to form a 3D structure (artificial skin) recapitulating most of the properties of the
                epidermis is routinely used as a tool for drug development and testing.</p>
            <h3 id = "Hyperplasia">Hyperplasia</h3>
            <p>Epidermal hyperplasia (thickening resulting from cell proliferation) has various forms:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Acanthosis</b> is diffuse epidermal hyperplasia (thickening of the skin, and not to be confused with acanthocytes).[28] It
                    implies increased thickness of the Malpighian layer (stratum basale and stratum spinosum).[29] Acanthosis nigricans is a
                    black, poorly defined, velvety hyperpigmented acanthosis, usually observed in the back of neck, axilla, and other folded
                    regions of the skin.
                </li>
                <li><b>Focal epithelial hyperplasia</b> (Heck's disease) is an asymptomatic, benign neoplastic condition characterized by
                    multiple white
                    to pinkish papules that occur diffusely in the oral cavity.
                </li>
                <li><b>Pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia</b> (PEH) is a benign condition characterized by hyperplasia of the epidermis and
                    epithelium of
                    skin appendages, with irregular squamous strands extending down into the dermis, and closely simulating squamous cell
                    carcinoma (SCC).
                </li>
            </ul>
